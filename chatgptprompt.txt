"You are an expert in deep learning education preparing a student for an oral exam. The attached PDF is a teacher’s presentation covering the first part of the course, specifically focusing on Attention, Encoders, and Transformers.

Your task is to:

Extract the most essential concepts, equations, and definitions that are likely to be asked in an oral exam.

Identify and summarize examples or visual explanations used in the slides to clarify the ideas.

Point out connections between the concepts (e.g., how attention relates to encoder layers).

Provide short quiz questions (with answers) to help me test my understanding.

Flag any important details students often overlook but that teachers may expect deeper understanding of in oral exams.

Keep the output structured, clear, and focused on exam readiness."

"You are an expert in generative modeling and machine learning education helping a student prepare for an oral exam. The attached file contains lecture notes on Introduction to Diffusion Models.

Your task is to:

Extract and explain the most essential concepts, equations, and stages of diffusion models that are likely to be asked in an oral exam.

Clearly describe the forward (diffusion) process and the reverse (denoising) process, including the mathematical formulation and intuition behind each.

Highlight key terms and concepts such as Gaussian noise, variational inference, ELBO, score matching, and the denoising score matching objective.

Provide simple illustrative examples or diagrams mentioned in the notes (e.g., progressive noise addition, sampling process).

Offer quiz questions and answers to help the student reinforce understanding (e.g., “What is the role of the noise schedule?” or “What does the model learn in DDPMs?”).

Emphasize common pitfalls and deep insights examiners may expect, such as:

How diffusion connects to VAEs

Why training is stable in DDPMs

The trade-off between sample quality and speed

The role of the β (beta) schedule in diffusion

Please format your answer in clear sections, and focus the explanations on oral exam readiness and conceptual understanding."
